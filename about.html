                The decision to quit smoking is the most important step you can
                take to improve your overall health. It is NEVER too late to
                quit. By quitting smoking, you can:

                  Decrease your risk of disease (including lung cancer, throat
                  cancer, emphysema, heart disease, high blood pressure, ulcers
                  and reflux, erectile and sexual dysfunction, kidney disease,

                With the support from our mentors and peers, we were able to
                conduct around 40 hours of clean-up all around Pune, picking up
                stray cigarette butts and more. We also raised awareness as to
                how cigarette bin installation works. Talking to localites about
                their behavour towards this was both enlightening and gave us
                the epiphany as to how casually people can ignore common hygiene
                practices.
