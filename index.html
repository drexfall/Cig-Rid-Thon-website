            Cig-Rid-Thon is an attempt to reduce the cigarette butt pollution
            crisis we are facing right now. This website is designed to help
            people realise and be aware of cigarette butts lying around them.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I asked you, what is the most common form of plastic pollution,
            what would you say? Plastic bottles? Straws?
          </p>

          <p>
            While these are good guesses, they are not the correct answer.
            Cigarette butts are actually the most abundant form of plastic waste
            in the world, with about 4.5 trillion individual butts polluting our
            global environment. But wait, aren't cigarette butts made of cotton
            or paper? NO, cigarette butts are primarily plastic. Cigarette butts
            are small and tend to go unnoticed but they are hiding almost
            everywhere. Contrary to what many believe, cigarette butts are not
            harmless. They are made of cellulose acetate, a man-made plastic
            material, and contain hundreds of toxic chemicals. While cigarette
            filters, or the plastic part of butts, can take up to 10 years to
            completely degrade, the chemicals they release can remain in the
            environment for many more years beyond the life of the cigarette
            butt itself.

          <p>
            Cigarette butts are small and tend to go unnoticed but they are
            hiding almost everywhere. Contrary to what many believe, cigarette
            butts are not harmless. They are made of cellulose acetate, a
            man-made plastic material, and contain hundreds of toxic chemicals.
            While cigarette filters, or the plastic part of butts, can take up
            to 10 years to completely degrade, the chemicals they release can
            remain in the environment for many more years beyond the life of the
            cigarette butt itself.

        <article class="mt-5">
          <h3 class="mb-4">How does this affect you?</h3>
          <p>
            These lingering toxins include arsenic (also used in rat poisoning),
            lead (a poison that can affect the brain development of children)
            and nicotine. When these toxic plastics are improperly disposed of
            on the street corner or out the car window, they slowly leach toxins
            into our natural systems, presenting a serious threat to us and our
            environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is especially true for low-income communities of color. These
            communities tend to have higher smoking rates due to a long history
            of targeting by the tobacco industry and face systemic inequities
            that make it harder for them to access health information and
            resources. On top of this, they disproportionately receive
            inequitable waste management services, which can lead to greater
            effects from cigarette butt pollution.

          <h3 class="mb-4">Way Forward</h3>
          <p>
            Local authorities should come up with rules and regulations to
            protect the environment from non-biodegradable cigarette butt waste
            by:
          </p>
          <p>
            Implementing a consumer-funded Advanced Recycling Fee; or waste fee
            for cigarettes at the point of purchase. These fees are intended to
            pay for the costs of collecting, recycling and properly disposing of
            cigarette butts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cities like San Francisco have added additional cigarette taxes to
            compensate for the cost of waste management. It helps clean up more
            than half the cigarette butts and packaging litter from the streets.
          </p>
          <p>
            The city now charges a 60-cent fee on packs of cigarettes to cover
            clean-up costs and is the first city, back in 2009, to levy a
            cigarette litter abatement fee.
          </p>
          <p>
            Urban local bodies should enforce laws and fines against littering
            and violations of smoking bans in public places and beaches to
            compensate for the costs of cleaning up and disposing of cigarette
            waste.
          </p>
          <p>
            Awareness and cleaning campaigns like Nitri Datta's ButtRush, a
            marathon to collect and recycle tonnes of cigarette waste, can help
            deal with the menace. The campaign Could collect nearly one crore
            cigarette butts in 2021, weighing around three tonnes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, the Noida-based start-up code buys cigarette butts at Rs
            800 per kg and recycles them to make durable items like home decor,
            mosquito repellents, compost ash, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initiatives like product redesign, extended producer responsibility,
            fines, penalties and promoting non-profits for awareness programmes
            and recycling shall be helpful to curb the issue.
